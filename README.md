# Hackathon-Zebrahack
This project has been developed in a 10 hours hackathon organised by the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science. The theme of the hackathon has been green energy and each team had to implement its best ideas in order to have a website which had to contain at least: a navigation bar, a video, images and had to be responsive.
The team imagined a real world scenario: we were given a simple task to create a website for a company which offers solutions for their custommers's needs in terms of solar pannels. 
The code has been written in HTML, CSS and JS for some animations and slideshow. The final product consists of 5 pages: home page, about us, solutions (company's recommendation regardin pannels), faq and a contact page.
